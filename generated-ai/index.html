        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) was used in the making of this film. Specifically, text-generating chatbots were involved in the following parts of the script:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most ChatAI Pro (ChatGPT/Microsoft Copilot) and Dramatic Albert (Google Gemini) lines</li>
            <li>Scripted Youtuber lines (ChatGPT)</li>
            <li>Some Craig lines (Various)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Additionally, AI chatbot(s) were used for the general layout of the main ChatAIPro website (free and
            upgraded), as well as the upgrade pages. The icons used on the website were taken and modified from Google
            Icons.</p>
        <p>Text-to-image AI tools were used to generate the following images:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The "stuck in traffic" image (shown at 6:17)</li>
            <li>Two Youtube video thumbnails (shown at 0:26 and 3:56)</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>Text-to-video AI tools were not used in any part of this film. AI was not involved in any other part of this film. AI was not involved in the making of this website.</p>
